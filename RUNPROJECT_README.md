HOW TO USE OR RUN THE PROJECT

*The Main class to run for the program to start is "Home.java".

The project was done to enable two actors interact with the system.
That is a Manager and an Employee where each actor has to log in before interacting with the system.

The Manager was given a name as "admin" and a password as "9999"(number not a String).

The Employees were grouped into old employees and new employee.
The only Old employee in the system is "Ernest" whose password is "111"(number not a String).

As the program is started , the new Employee list is empty meaning you can't try logging in as a new Employee unless you're added by the Manager.
After the Manager adds a new Employee, the details provided can then be used to log in as a new employee.
